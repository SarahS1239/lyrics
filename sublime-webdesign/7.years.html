	Once I was seven years old my mama told me<br />
	Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely<br />
	Once I was seven years old <br /><br />

	It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger<br />
	Pushing each other to the limits, we were<br /> learning quicker<br /><br />

	By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor<br />
	Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure<br /><br />

	Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me<br />
	Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely<br />
	Once I was eleven years old<br /><br />

	I always had that dream like my daddy before me<br />
	So I started writing songs, I started writing stories<br />
	Something about that glory, just always seemed to bore me<br />
	Cause only those I really love will ever really know me<br /><br />

	Once I was 20 years old, my story got told<br />
	Before the morning sun, when life was lonely<br />
	Once I was 20 years old <br /><br />


	I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure<br />
	Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major<br /><br />

	I got my boys with me at least those in favor<br />
	And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later<br /><br />

	Once I was 20 years old, my story got told<br />
	I was writing about everything, I saw before me<br />
	Once I was 20 years old<br /><br />

	Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold<br />
	We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming<br /><br />

	Soon we'll be 30 years old<br /><br />

	I'm still learning about life<br />
	My woman brought children for me<br />
	So I can sing them all my songs<br />
	And I can tell them stories<br />
	Most of my boys are with me<br />
	Some are still out seeking glory<br />
	And some I had to leave behind<br />
	My brother I'm still sorry<br /><br />

	Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61<br />
	Remember life and then your life becomes a better one<br />
	I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once<br />
	I hope my children come and visit, once or<br /> twice a month<br /><br />

	Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold<br />
	Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
	Soon I'll be 60 years old<br />
	Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold<br />
	Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
	Soon  'll be 60 years old<br /><br />

	Once I was seven years old, my mama told me<br />
	Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely<br />
	Once I was seven years old
